# Member target resolution

Member target resolution is the typed seam between user selectors, API surface
members, durable member anchors, and physical body evidence.

`MemberTargetResolver` owns semantic selection for a member within an `ApiType`.
It consumes a `MemberTargetSelector` rather than a loose tuple of strings, so
selector details survive past command-line parsing:

- normalized member name
- `Name:N` overload index
- `Name~digest` stable selector prefix
- generic method arity from `M<T>` / `M<TKey,TValue>`
- kind qualifiers: `operator:`, `explicit:`, and `extension:`

The resolver returns `ResolvedMemberTarget`, which carries the API member handle,
its `MemberAnchor`, selector/declaring overload indexes, and a `BodyTarget` when
the selected API member maps to a physical declaring member. Projected extension
methods use this body target to preserve the difference between the API target
and the member that owns IL/native metadata evidence.

Diagnostics are typed (`MemberTargetDiagnosticKind`) and include candidate
anchors for ambiguous or out-of-range selections. CLI commands should render the
diagnostic instead of falling back to partial string matching.

## Boundaries

- Lexical command helpers may still identify source/type/member argument slots,
  but semantic member resolution should flow through `MemberTargetResolver`.
- Commands that target API changes, such as `diff -m/--member`, should resolve
  selectors against the old/new API surfaces and filter by the resulting
  `MemberAnchor` identities rather than by re-parsing display text.
- `MemberAnchor` remains the durable user/agent-facing identity; producer-native
  references remain producer evidence and should not be replaced by selectors.
- The resolver lives in `ILInspector.Metadata`, so it stays SRM-only and has no
  decompiler dependency.
